            "outputs": [
                {
                    "type": "Markdown Documentation",
                    "description": "Full markdown documentation for architecture.",
                    "template": "templates/markdown_template.md"
                },
                {
                    "type": "Mermaid Diagrams",
                    "description": "Technical diagrams using Mermaid.",
                    "template": "templates/mermaid_template.md"
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "name": "Data Scientist",
            "definition": "A Data Scientist specializing in machine learning and data analysis.",
            "function": "Analyzes data, builds models, and generates insights.",

Great! Let’s dive into the implementation steps one by one. I’ll guide you through creating the role_definition.json file, setting up the templates/ directory, and implementing the logic to load definitions, edit prompts, and generate outputs. We’ll also discuss how to test the system.

Step 1: Create the role_definition.json File
This file will define the roles (e.g., Solution Architect, Data Scientist) and their associated outputs. Here’s how to create it:

Create the File:

Create a new file named role_definition.json in the root directory of your project.

Define Roles and Outputs:

Add the following JSON structure to the file:

json
Copy
{
    "roles": [
        {
            "name": "Solution Architect",
            "definition": "A Senior Solutions Architect specializing in web components, design systems, and enterprise frontend architectures.",
            "function": "Defines and documents architectural patterns, integration touchpoints, technical requirements, performance targets, and security controls.",
            "outputs": [
                {
                    "type": "Markdown Documentation",
                    "description": "Full markdown documentation for architecture.",
                    "template": "templates/markdown_template.md"
                },
                {
                    "type": "Mermaid Diagrams",
                    "description": "Technical diagrams using Mermaid.",
                    "template": "templates/mermaid_template.md"
                },
                {
                    "type": "Implementation Matrices",
                    "description": "Matrices for component scoring, browser support, and integration assessment.",
                    "template": "templates/matrix_template.md"
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "name": "Data Scientist",
            "definition": "A Data Scientist specializing in machine learning and data analysis.",
            "function": "Analyzes data, builds models, and generates insights.",
            "outputs": [
                {
                    "type": "Jupyter Notebook",
                    "description": "Interactive notebooks for data analysis.",
                    "template": "templates/notebook_template.ipynb"
                },
                {
                    "type": "Data Visualizations",
                    "description": "Visualizations for data insights.",
                    "template": "templates/visualization_template.html"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
Step 2: Create the templates/ Directory
This directory will store all the predefined templates for generating outputs. Here’s how to set it up:

Create the Directory:

Create a new directory named templates/ in the root directory of your project.

Add Template Files:

Create the following template files inside the templates/ directory:

Markdown Documentation: markdown_template.md

markdown
Copy
# {Role Name} Documentation

## Overview
{Role Definition}

## Function
{Role Function}

## Outputs
- {Output 1}
- {Output 2}
Mermaid Diagrams: mermaid_template.md

markdown
Copy
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User] --> B[Frontend]
    B --> C[Backend]
    C --> D[API]
Copy
Implementation Matrices: matrix_template.md

markdown
Copy

Copy
{
  "cells": [
    {
      "cell_type": "markdown",
      "metadata": {},
      "source": [
        "# Data Analysis Notebook"
      ]
    }
  ],

    "kernelspec": {
      "display_name": "Python 3",
      "language": "python",
      "name": "python3"
    }
  }
}
Data Visualizations: visualization_template.html

html
Copy
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Data Visualization</title>
    <script src="https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-latest.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="chart"></div>
    <script>
        var data = [{x: [1, 2, 3], y: [4, 5, 6], type: 'scatter'}];
        Plotly.newPlot('chart', data);
    </script>
</body>
</html>
Run HTML
Step 3: Implement the Logic
Now, let’s implement the logic to load definitions, edit prompts, and generate outputs. Here’s how to do it:

Load the JSON File:

Use Python to load the role_definition.json file and parse it into a dictionary.

Example:

python
Copy
import json

with open('role_definition.json', 'r') as file:
    role_definitions = json.load(file)
Load Templates:

Use Python to load the templates from the templates/ directory.

Example:

python
Copy
def load_template(template_path):
    with open(template_path, 'r') as file:
        return file.read()

markdown_template = load_template('templates/markdown_template.md')
mermaid_template = load_template('templates/mermaid_template.md')
Edit Prompts:

Allow users to edit the {system} and {user} prompts in the app interface.

Example:

python
Copy
system_prompt = "You are a Senior Solutions Architect. Your task is to create a detailed implementation for the architecture documentation package."
user_prompt = "Generate a detailed implementation for the architecture documentation package."
Generate Outputs:

Use the templates to dynamically generate outputs based on the selected role and prompts.

Example:

python
Copy
def generate_markdown(role, system_prompt, user_prompt):
    return markdown_template.format(
        Role_Name=role['name'],
        Role_Definition=role['definition'],
        Role_Function=role['function'],
        Output_1=role['outputs'][0]['description'],
        Output_2=role['outputs'][1]['description']
    )

markdown_output = generate_markdown(role_definitions['roles'][0], system_prompt, user_prompt)
print(markdown_output)
Step 4: Test the System
Test with Different Roles:

Test the system with different roles (e.g., Solution Architect, Data Scientist) to ensure the correct outputs are generated.

Test with Different Prompts:

Test the system with different {system} and {user} prompts to ensure the outputs are dynamic and customizable.

Verify Outputs:

Verify that the generated outputs (e.g., Markdown documentation, Mermaid diagrams) match the templates and are properly formatted.

Next Steps
Expand the App:

Add more roles, package levels, and templates as needed.

Integrate additional features such as file cleaning, user authentication, and external API integrations.

Improve the UI/UX:

Enhance the user interface for better usability and accessibility.

Add features like drag-and-drop file uploads, real-time collaboration, and interactive dashboards.
