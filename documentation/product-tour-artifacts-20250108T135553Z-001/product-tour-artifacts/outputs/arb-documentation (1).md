# Product Tour Web Component
## Architecture Review Board Documentation Package
Version 1.0 | Date: November 21, 2024

### Executive Summary
The Product Tour Web Component provides a standardized solution for implementing product tours across SAP applications. This solution enables content authors to create and maintain tours through familiar tools while ensuring consistent delivery through modern web technologies.

### 1. Architecture Change Request

**Project Details**
- Name: Product Tour Web Component
- Department: UDEx Team
- Implementation Timeline: Immediate
- Status: Approved

**Business Case**
The current product tour implementation requires significant developer intervention and lacks consistency across products. This solution standardizes the approach while empowering content authors through familiar tools.

**Technical Overview**
- Implementation Type: Web Component
- Content Management: SharePoint/Word + Adobe EDS
- Delivery: UDEx CDN
- Client Runtime: Shadow DOM + Custom Events

### 2. Architecture Principles Compliance

#### Enterprise Architecture Alignment
✓ Modular Design
- Independent web component architecture
- Clear separation of concerns between content and presentation
- Standardized interfaces for integration

✓ Scalability
- CDN-based delivery ensures global scale
- Stateless component design
- Content-driven architecture minimizes maintenance

✓ Reusability
- Framework-agnostic implementation
- Standardized content structure
- Configurable through HTML attributes

#### Technical Standards Compliance

**Performance**
- Lazy loading of assets
- Shadow DOM for style encapsulation
- Efficient DOM updates

**Security**
- Content served via HTTPS
- No external dependencies
- Sandboxed component implementation

**Integration**
- Standard web component APIs
- Event-based communication
- Clear integration documentation

### 4. Implementation Guidelines

#### Content Authoring
1. Access the SharePoint Word template
2. Edit content following the structured format
3. Preview using Adobe EDS sidekick
4. Publish when ready

#### Integration Steps
```html
<product-tour 
    data-config="[content-url]"
    data-url-prefix="[domain]">
</product-tour>
```

#### Event System
```javascript
document.addEventListener('tourStarted', (event) => {
    console.log('Tour started:', event.detail);
});
```

### 5. Risk Assessment
